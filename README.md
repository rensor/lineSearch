# lineSearch
Line-Search algorithm

Perform 1D line-search analysis to determine optimum step length. 

Contains the follwing functionallity
  1. Bracket local minimum i.e., determine upper and lower bounds of step-size
  2. Golden Sections, determine optimum step-size within upper and lower bounds
  3. Steady increase, determine optimum step-size within upper and lower bounds using the Strong Wolfe conditions
  4. Backtracking, determine step-size based on back-tracking approach using the Armijo-Goldstein condition
